# EIP-7702 Casual Hackathon

**Account Abstraction** is becoming one of the most transformative topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. The introduction of **EIP-7702** marks a pragmatic and visionary step forward in this domain.

We believe that meaningful innovation doesn't always come from boardrooms or conference stages — it often starts with a late-night hack or a sudden spark in your code editor.

Bring your creativity, code, and maybe a cup of iced coffee — and help shape the next chapter of Account Abstraction.

## ⏰ Event Timeline

- Open registration: 1-6 Jun. Learn from repo (or add more docs, ideas, examples!) + pop-up workshops
- Open Day: 6 Jun. Deep-dive 7702, Q&A, team match
- Hacking: 6 Jun - 8 Jun. Couch-friendly hacking weekend
- Demo day: 8 Jun. Submit on GitHub, live show, fun prizes

## 🌿 What is Casual Hackathon?

Low-cost, casual hackathons that let anyone revel in the pure joy of creating — and spark real innovation in return. Casual Hackathon is an open-source public good created by LXDAO.

### ✨ Core Principles

- **Lightweight operation**: Online-first, casual participation, no pressure — extremely low operational overhead.
- **Open-source public good**: Fully open-source with no patent restrictions; any group can adopt or fork it.
- **De-commercialized**: No mandatory prize pools or sponsor KPIs — bounty hunters stay away, creativity comes first.
- **Relaxed participation**: No forced all-nighters or on-site attendance; health and enjoyment matter.
- **Everyone wins**: Judges present a unique award to every project, giving all ideas their moment.
- **Curated themes**: Carefully curated prompts that spark imagination and encourage playful, cutting-edge development

## 🧩 Why 7702? Why Now?

**EIP-7702** addresses key limitations of **EIP-3074** while preserving its core strength: temporarily turning EOAs into smart accounts.

Key benefits:

- ✅ **Backwards-compatible** (works alongside ERC-4337)
- ✅ **Highly extensible** (supports custom validation logic)
- ✅ **Improved security model** (avoids permanent delegation risks)

This isn't just a fix — it's a new design space for wallets, dApps, security, identity, and permissions.

**Now** is the time to build, test, question, and innovate — hands-on, from the ground up.

## 🛠 Highlights

✨ **Tech Talks**

- Deep dives into EIP-7702
- Evolution of Abstract Accounts
- Modular account architecture trends

💬 **Online Hacking Space**

- Small, high-signal discussion groups
- Shared collab code zones
- Global devs co-building across time zones

🧑‍⚖️ **Expert Judges**
